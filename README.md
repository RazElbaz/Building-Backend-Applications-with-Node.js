#  Building Backend Applications with Node.js

## Overview

This README serves as a summary of the results and accomplishments from the "Building Backend Applications with Node.js" course. In this course, we explored the fundamentals of building backend applications using Node.js, with a focus on deploying them on auto-scaling containers on AWS.

## What Was Achieved

- **To-Do List Backend Application**: Through the course, I successfully developed a To-Do List backend application using Node.js and Express. The application allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently.

- **Containerization with Docker**: I gained the knowledge and hands-on experience required to containerize the To-Do List application using Docker. Containerization not only makes the application more portable but also simplifies deployment and scaling.

- **AWS Fargate Deployment**: One of the course highlights was deploying the To-Do List application on AWS Fargate. AWS Fargate's capabilities for provisioning, monitoring, and auto-scaling compute resources were harnessed to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

- **Custom Domain Setup**: As an optional step, I also explored the process of purchasing a custom domain and configuring it to point to our deployed application. This allows worldwide access to the To-Do List app through a unique domain name.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the course, I acquired valuable knowledge in the following areas:

- **JavaScript and Node.js**: I gained a solid foundation in JavaScript and Node.js, enabling me to develop backend applications efficiently.

- **Creating a Simple Web Application**: I learned how to create a straightforward web application, focusing primarily on the backend components.

- **Hosting on AWS with Auto-Scaling**: The course provided insights into hosting web applications on AWS, with an emphasis on auto-scaling features to ensure the application can handle varying levels of traffic.

## Showcase

To showcase my achievements, I have deployed the To-Do List backend application on AWS Fargate, making it accessible through a custom domain:

I invite you to explore the application, add tasks, and experience the seamless scalability provided by AWS Fargate.

## Next Steps

This course has equipped me with a strong foundation in backend development using Node.js and AWS. The knowledge gained can be leveraged to work on more complex projects and delve into advanced topics, including serverless computing, AWS services, and application optimization.
